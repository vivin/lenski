Lenski Experiment
=================

An agent-based model in DEVS that attempts to replicate the Lenski experiment. I have created a model here that simulates the evolution of the ability to metabolize a novel nutrient-source. In the Lenski experiment, a strain of E. Coli was observed to have the ability to metabolize citrate. This is an ability that is not present in wild-type E. Coli. This model tries to simulate the same thing. It uses a simple genetic-algorithm along with a fitness function that is based on the efficiency of an enzyme to metabolize a particular nutrient. The model successfully displays the emergence of a novel ability. There are a few shortcomings however, that are mentioned in the PDF I have committed with the code.
